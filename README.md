Hands-On Geospatial Analysis with R and QGIS 3.4 [Video], published by Packt


About the Video Course
This course introduces you to the full workflow from acquiring data, data wrangling and analysing to outputting and publishing visualisation products. We will touch on a variety of datasets including remote sensing data and techniques to incorporate machine learning in the analytical steps in QGIS. We will further investigate geospatial analysis using the most up-to-date R packages such as ggplot2, raster, sf, Leaflet and Shiny.
By the end of the course, you will be able to produce interactive maps and professional cartographic products, deploy them as a Shiny application, and critique on a variety of end-results.


What You Will Learn
1.	Develop a Shiny application for geospatial data processing and visualizations using R and QGIS 3.4.
2.	Implement an efficient and reproducible workflow for geospatial analysis.
3.	Create interactive and professional mapping products and publish them on open applications. 
4.	Conduct advanced geospatial analyses that address practical issues such as land cover using machine algorithms.
5.	Use modern and novel techniques to code with best practices.
6.	Utilize skills to serve a wide range of groups, including governmental organizations, Academia, consulting firms, and natural-resource industries.
7.	Critique a variety of geospatial data products and optimize your geospatial abilities to communicate your findings effectively
