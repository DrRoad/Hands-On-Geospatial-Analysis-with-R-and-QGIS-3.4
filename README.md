Hands-On Geospatial Analysis with R and QGIS 3.4 [Video], published by Packt


About the Video Course<br/>

This course introduces you to the full workflow from acquiring data, data wrangling and analysing to outputting and publishing visualisation products. We will touch on a variety of datasets including remote sensing data and techniques to incorporate machine learning in the analytical steps in QGIS. We will further investigate geospatial analysis using the most up-to-date R packages such as ggplot2, raster, sf, Leaflet and Shiny.
By the end of the course, you will be able to produce interactive maps and professional cartographic products, deploy them as a Shiny application, and critique on a variety of end-results.


What You Will Learn<br/>

● Develop a Shiny application for geospatial data processing and visualizations using R and QGIS 3.4.<br/>
● Implement an efficient and reproducible workflow for geospatial analysis.<br/>
● Create interactive and professional mapping products and publish them on open applications.<br/> 
● Conduct advanced geospatial analyses that address practical issues such as land cover using machine algorithms.<br/>
● Use modern and novel techniques to code with best practices.<br/>
● Utilize skills to serve a wide range of groups, including governmental organizations, Academia, consulting firms, and natural-resource industries.<br/>
● Critique a variety of geospatial data products and optimize your geospatial abilities to communicate your findings effectively<br/>
